# Eco-friends
A web app that allows users to input information about and save the location of observed local environmental issues. It will also allow users to view information input by other users and provide a platform for all users to communicate together with.

As of right now, only the input forms and map pin drop feature works. The ability to save form data after a page refresh and account creation and all other features that require more backend experience do not work yet.

My motivation for creating this project was to provide an easier way to record and also let others see reports of local environmental issues. Current environmental apps don't provide an easy way for users to see possible issues affecting there area. This project aims to give people access to a crowd sourced pool of information of local environmental issues.
