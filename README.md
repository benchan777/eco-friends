# Eco-friends
A web app that allows users to input information about and save the location of observed local environmental issues. It will also allow users to view information input by other users and provide a platform for all users to communicate together with.

As of right now, only the input forms and map pin drop feature works. The ability to save form data after a page refresh and account creation and all other features that require more backend experience do not work yet.
